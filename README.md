# citibke-challenge
Repository for Module 18 UPenn Data Science Bootcamp challenge

## Overview
For this challenge, we used the Citi Bike database to collect and analyze data on bike usage throughout New York.  I chose to use the data from July 2023, which is one of the peak tourist months for New York City.  My goal was to look at the most-used stations to see if there was a correlation between station usage and popular tourist destinations.

## Summary of Results
In examining the top 10 most used stations by number of riders, in almost every case, the number of members using bikes exceeded the number of casual riders.  This would indicate that most people utilizing the Citi Bikes are not one-time riders; rather, they are riding the bikes multiple times per month, although that assumption would require futher analysis of individual member subscriptions.

When looking at top 10 most used start stations by rider types, while many of the stations were the same, the order was different.  The top stations for members were close to transit hubs in the city, indicating that riders could be using the Citi Bikes as part of their daily commute to and from work.  For casual riders, the top station was at Central Park South, an extremely popular tourist destination.  It's possible that tourists are renting bikes and taking them through the park as part of their visit and returning to to the same station.

Finally, when examining the top 10 start and end stations on the map, we can see that the majority are clustered in the western, central, and southern regions of Manhattan.  The popularity of the western side stations could be a result of the proximity of the ferry docks for visitors and workers traveling across the Hudson from New Jersey.  Central Manhattan, with Times Square, Central Park, and many of the Park Avenue office buildings, is another place densely populated by tourists and workers.  Finally, the southern end of Manhattan with its proximity to the river walk and Wall Street could account for the heavy traffic there.
